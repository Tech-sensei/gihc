      "Our Transformative Journey In December 2020, a divine spark ignited the vision of the Great Ife Hangout Community, a concept brought to life with a fervor and the support of remarkable individuals. Initially labeled 'GreatIfeLasgidiHangout1.0,' we set forth on a path guided by a higher purpose. Amid financial challenges, the unwavering commitment of individuals like Fynestboi, Debola, and others provided the foundation for our dream in a way. Notable personalities like Abass Oyeyemi (of blessed memory), Blaqboo, Woli Arole, Ajayi Oluwafemi, and 2much Akanni stood by our side, playing pivotal roles in the success of the event. Brands like Nixmar and Swags, Babafaros and Unik Properties contributed generously. Darma PR and Aduragbemi Oladunjoye played pivotal roles in spreading the message alongside other PRs and persons within the Great Ife circle. Our inaugural event in Lagos brought together both OAU individuals and non including the likes of Sleeky, Segun Komolafe (Who played the voluntary role of our photographer that day), Olaogun Olamide (the cook of the day), Yusuf Busayo, Adebola Esther and many more who selflessly supported our cause. Our initial team members included Akanho Olanshile, Olagoke Toluwabori, Okiki, Fashoyin Adebiyi, Aduragbemi Oladunjoye, Komolafe Tolulope Joshua and others. The first edition aimed at supporting businesses of our own, with most participants and those we engaged with services to render being products (mostly undergraduates) of Great Ife. We express our gratitude to these individuals, as well as our sisters and our mum, who played indispensable roles. It's important to mention that reaching out to alumni and students with opportunities to share is one of the core aspects of our mission. We aim to connect and empower our extended Great Ife family within the scope of our mission and purpose. Femi Fatokun Olaifa, who was informed about this idea early on, played a key role in shaping our success. His advice and guidance were invaluable, contributing to the event's achievements. Bamigboye Damilola, Adeyemi Oluwapelumi, Olakunle Sanyaolu, Shaledralee, Opakume, Oyinkosola, Adebola Esther, Mujeeb Lawal, CEO Afkit, and friends were among the attendees at the first edition in Lagos. This time, our community is better structured, aiming to benefit undergraduates, postgraduates, graduates, the Ile-Ife community, and anyone connected to our hangouts. Beyond networking, we aspire to foster the growth of local businesses of our community members. One of our goals is to provide opportunities and support, transcending the boundaries of campus life, reaching out to alumni and students who have opportunities to share. We are excited to embark on this journey of impact and growth. Come on this journey with us!",
